Shoelace example:
Take one shoelace in each hand
Tighten the strings by pulling away from the shoe
Cross the laces in the center
Switch the laces to the opposite hand (right lace in left hand, left lace in right hand)
Tuck the right lace under the left lace and pull back up to form a knot
Make a loop with the lace in your right hand
Wrap the lace in your left hand around the base of the loop in the right hand
Pull from the middle of the left lace and oull it through the knot, making a second bow
Done
